## Obsidian Kanban Plugin

Note: This plugin is currently in alpha. Please submit any bugs or feature requests here: https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/issues

This plugin allows creating markdown-backed Kanban boards. For example, this Kanban board:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/main/screenshots/01.png" alt="Plugin screenshot 1" />

Will output this markdown:

```markdown
---

kanban: basic

---


## Another List

- [ ] Card in list one


## List two

- [ ] This is a card in list two
- [ ] This is another
- [ ] Hello, world!


## Done

**Complete**
- [x] Items in this lane are marked as complete
```

## Screenshots

Create a new Kanban from the command palette:
